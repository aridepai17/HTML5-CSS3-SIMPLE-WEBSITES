                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Canceling your Netflix subscription can be done through a variety of methods, depending on how you originally signed up for the service. If you subscribed through the Netflix website, you can log into your account, go to the "Account" section, and click "Cancel Membership" under the "Membership & Billing" area. For those who have the Netflix app on their mobile device, the process is similar - access your account settings, go to "Account Details," and select the option to cancel your subscription. Subscribers who signed up through third-party platforms like Google Play or iTunes can also cancel directly through those channels by managing their subscriptions. Regardless of the method, the key steps are to locate your account information, navigate to the cancellation section, and confirm the termination of your Netflix plan. After canceling, you'll typically be able to use the service until the end of your current billing period. And if you change your mind, you can reactivate your account within 10 months of cancellation without losing your viewing history and preferences.</p>
